# Microprocessors
#### Laboratory Exercises within the 'Digital Design 2' course in C and Verilog concerning the understanding and design of basic computer circuits (such as memory) and their extension (such as support for more instructions).
Finally, we develop basic algorithms for testing them (such as Monte Carlo) and additionally bencmarks.
