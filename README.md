# Microprocessors
#### Laboratory Exercises in the context of the course 'Digital Design 2' in C and Verilog concerning the understanding and design of basic computer circuits (such as memory, gates) and their extension (such as support for more instructions). Finally, we develop basic algorithms for testing them (such as Monte Carlo) and additionally bencmarks.
Regarding the detailed implementation of each workshop, the details are listed in the report of each workshop separately in pdf
